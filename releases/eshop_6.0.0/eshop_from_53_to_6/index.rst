Update OXID eShop from version 4.10 / 5.3 to version 6.0.0
==========================================================

This guide acts on the assumption you have an already running OXID eShop 4.10 / 5.3 and want to update it to OXID
eShop 6.0.0. If you do not have the newest patch release of 4.10 / 5.3, you should first update to this patch release.
A helping approach regarding the update is to deactivate all modules and then successively activate them after the update.
Read the documentation about all changes carefully. In some cases you have to take actions, in some cases not. This
depends on your OXID eShop, the modules, user data or the theme you are using.
Please also have a look at the
`source code documentation <http://docu.oxid-esales.com/CE/sourcecodedocumentation/4.10.5/deprecated.html>`__ for
deprecated classes and methods. The update manual is divided into several chapters:
